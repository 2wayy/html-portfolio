<h1>Nisis Show Recommendation</h1>

<h2>My top 5 shows of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>
Speaks for itself. Great adventure with a lot of different islands and critcs towards society.
and the proof that the boarder between good and evil is sometimes smaller than it might seem on first glimpse.
</p>

<h3>Agents of Shield</h3>
<p>What I like most about the show is, that you can relate to each characther, which usually made a great development in the course of the show as well.</p>

<h3>Moon Knight</h3>
<p>The mixture of the great acting and the serios background makes a great show, that is refreshingly different from other Marvel projects.</p>

<h3>My Hero Academia</h3>
<p>From 0 to Hero! Only if you believe in yourself, you will be able to accomplish something. Hard work will pay off, as proven by Izuku Midorya in My Hero Academia.</p>

<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>All time classic! A show that never gets boring and where you can still catch yourself laughing even at the 3rd watch-through.</p>
